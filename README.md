# Plato.Collections

A library of immutable abstract data types inspired by LINQ. 
Plato.Collections is built in Platonic C# and is fully compatible with .NET Standard 2.0. 

## Platonic C# 

Platonic C# is a set of coding guidelines for using C# that enable data structures and algorithms to be machine translated into the Plato language. 
Plato is being developed as a high-performance pure functional language that can target multiple platforms. 

## Basic Container 

The Plato.Collections library provides the following interfaces:
* `ISequence<T>`
* `IArray<T>`
* `ICountedSequence<T>`
* `ISet<T>`
* `IQueue<TKey>`
* `IDequeue<TKey>`
* `IStack<TKey>`
* `IHeap<TKey>`
* `IDictionary<TKey, TValue>`
* `IMultiDictionary<TKey, TValue>`
* `IBiDictionary<TKey, TValue>`


## Design Principles

Plato.Collections is designed starting from simple generic immutable interfaces, with a rich library extension methods, and factory functions.

Guiding principles:
* Simplicity over performance 
* Minimize interface footprint (as few functions and properties as possible)  
* Emphasize accurate representation of abstraction over implementation
* Define helpers and extra functions as extension methods
* Maximize the amount of code reuse 
* Use compilers and tools to achieve efficient code
